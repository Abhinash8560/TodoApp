# TodoApp
I have made this Todo application using HTML & CSS & JavaScript, where we will have edit and
delete each item in the todo list as well as delete all the items in the list
with the use of local storage so that all of our data will be stored in our browser even if we close the browser,
we wonâ€™t be losing any data. I have also implemented the search functionality to search the items in the list.
